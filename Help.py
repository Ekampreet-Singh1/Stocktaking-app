#To use the stokctaking app you can first choose with version you want but v4 is reccomended. Next you can either add stock or remove previous stock using the buttons that are on the screen. After u have removed or added all the stock make sure to refresh then save and exit. It is important that you save so that everything is saved to the Json file that the stocktaking system is using. If you want to view the stock you can either click view stock or just look at the listbox that is on the screen. If you want to clear all the stock you can click clear stock but be careful as this will remove all the stock and you will have to add it again. If you want to know what version of the app you are using click version info and a messagebox will pop up telling you what version you are using.
